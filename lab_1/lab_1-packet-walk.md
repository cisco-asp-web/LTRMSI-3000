# Lab 1: SRv6 uSID Packet Walk [5 Min]

### Description: 
This is a supplemental lab guide used to deconstruct the forwarding process of traffic through the SRv6 topology. In Lab 1 we established the SRv6 underlay and enabled SRv6 encapsulation of IPv4 traffic in the global forwarding table or default VRF. This is distinct from Lab 2 where we will add the virtualization concept of L3VPN + SRv6.

## Lab Objectives
The student upon completion of the Lab 1 packet walk should have achieved the following objectives:

* Understand how standard IPv4 or IPv6 packets are encapsulated with SRv6 headers
* Understand the forwarding behavior of SRv6 enabled routers
* Understand how SRv6 routers decapsulate and forward traffic as an IPv4 or IPv6 packet
* Understand how IPv6 only routers can participate in SRv6 networks.

## Packet Walk Results for traffic from Amsterdam to Rome over SRv6

The expected results of a packet capture on **xrd01** is to see ICMP IPv4 traffic sourced from **Amsterdam (10.101.1.2)** to a loopback interface on **Rome (20.0.0.1)** use SRv6 encapsulation across the network.

See results below and notice both the ICMP echo and ICMP echo reply packets with SRv6 encapsulation. 
> [!NOTE]
>  In this example the egress and return traffic both happened to be hashed through **xrd02**.
>  Path selection using the global routing table as you will see in the detailed packet walk below
>  has multiple ECMP path options.

1. Log into the Amsterdam container and start a continous ping to the Rome Container.

   ![Amsterdam login](../topo_drawings/lab1-packet-walk-amsterdam.png)

   ```
   ping 20.0.0.1 -i .5
   ```

   Example Output
   ```
   # ping 20.0.0.1 -i .5
   PING 20.0.0.1 (20.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
   64 bytes from 20.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=62 time=4.83 ms
   64 bytes from 20.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=62 time=3.81 ms
   64 bytes from 20.0.0.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=62 time=4.92 ms
   64 bytes from 20.0.0.1: icmp_seq=4 ttl=62 time=4.67 ms
   ```
2. Lets capture the traffic using EdgeShark to see the SRv6 encapsulated traffic egressing **xrd01**  We don't know which interface the traffic will be hashed through so we may need to capture on both G0/0/0/1 and G0/0/0/2 interfaces. Below is an example capture for G0/0/0/1:
   ![XRD01 Capture 01 ](../topo_drawings/lab1-packet-walk-capture-xrd01-1.png)
   By filtering only on ICMP packets, we should be able to see the traffic that is interesting to us.
   Launch Edgesharek and add in *icmp* into the filter bar.

   ![XRD01 Edgeshark ](../topo_drawings/lab1-packet-walk-capture-wireshark.png)

Now lets expand one of the ICMP packets so we can gather more details.
We can see in the Edgeshark screen shot below that we have an IPv6 outer header with an embedeed IPv4/ICMP packet:
   - IPv6 Source is: fc00:0:1111::1 : This is the ingress SRv6 node that inserted the outer header
   - IPv6 Destination is: fc00:0:7777:e004: This is a Segment Identifier (SID) that encodes a specific function or destination. => In our case:  End.DT4 Endpoint with decapsulation and IPv4 table lookup IPv4 L3VPN use (equivalent of a per-VRF VPN label) (For more information: https://www.segment-routing.net/images/201901-SRv6.pdf)
   - Next IP Header: 4 (IPIP)
   - IPv4 Source is: 10.101.1.2 Which is the IP Address configured on the Amsterdam Eth1 interface.
   - IPv4 Destination is: 20.0.0.1, which is the IP Address configured on the Rome container as a loopback inteface.

To see the encapsulated traffic further in the network, feel free to capture traffic using the visual code extension as previously shown. Or you can tcpdump links on **xrd02**, **xrd05**, etc. Examples:
   ```
   sudo ip netns exec clab-clus25-xrd02 tcpdump -lni Gi0-0-0-1
   sudo ip netns exec clab-clus25-xrd05 tcpdump -lni Gi0-0-0-1
   sudo ip netns exec clab-clus25-xrd03 tcpdump -lni Gi0-0-0-1
   sudo ip netns exec clab-clus25-xrd04 tcpdump -lni Gi0-0-0-1
   etc.
   ```



### SRv6 Encapsulation and BGP

In the above **xrd01** recieves IPv4 packets from Amsterdam destined to Rome. We will walk through the process of determining that SRv6 encapsulation is required and lookup process.

1. From **xrd01** we can see a lookup of the IPv4 DA address in the bgpv4 global routing table and the SRv6 SID associated with the route 20.0.0.0/24.
   ```
   show ip bgp ipv4 unicast 20.0.0.0/24
   ```

   Example truncated output:
   ```diff
   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:xrd01#show bgp ipv4 unicast 20.0.0.0/24
   Wed Jan 15 07:05:49.623 UTC

          SubSubTLV:
            T:1(Sid structure):
   ```

2. Lookup of fc00:0:7777:e005::/48 the in the global IPv6 routing table.
   ```
   show route ipv6 fc00:0:7777:e005::
   ```

   Output:
   ```

   ```

3. Lets now lookup in the CEF table to see the forwarding next hop.
   ```
   show ip cef 20.0.0.0/24
   ```

   Output:
   ```diff
