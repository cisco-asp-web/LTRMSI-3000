# Welcome to LTMSI-3000: Modern AI networks: IOS-XR, SRv6, Cilium, and SONiC

## Introduction: 

In this immersive hands-on lab, explore how next-generation AI networking fabrics can be designed and deployed using SRv6, Kubernetes-native networking with Cilium, and open-source data center technologies. You‚Äôll explore a new way to architect, program, and optimize traffic in high-performance compute environments using Cisco IOS-XR and SONiC. This session walks participants through a series of progressive tutorials and labs covering: - SRv6 fundamentals and real-world use cases for L3VPN and Traffic Engineering - Kubernetes integration using Cilium and SRv6 for modern service-aware routing - SONiC-based data center fabric bring-up and host-based SRv6. - Programmatic traffic control using custom SRv6 mappings and intelligent automation Participants will gain practical skills in deploying flexible, scalable, and programmable infrastructure purpose-built for AI, HPC, or cloud-native workloads. Whether you‚Äôre a network engineer, cloud architect, or AI infrastructure specialist, this session bridges the gap between architecture and hands-on implementation.

# dCloud lab Topology

The following diagram shows the high level architecture that will be used for this lab:

![dCloud Topology](./topo_drawings/dcloud-topology.png)


This lab environment provides a hands-on experience with modern, programmable network infrastructures using modular technologies: SONiC, XRd, Containerlab, Edgeshark, and Jalapeno.

To support this, we are using four virtual machines, each with a specific role. Here‚Äôs what each VM is responsible for:

##  ubuntu-clab ‚Äî The Topology Orchestrator

IP Address: 198.18.128.100

This VM is the core of your lab environment. It hosts:
	‚Ä¢	Containerlab, which is used to define and deploy virtual topologies using SONiC and XRd.
	‚Ä¢	Edgeshark, which provides traffic capture and visualization inside Containerlab.
	‚Ä¢	XRd images (Cisco‚Äôs virtual routing platform).
	‚Ä¢	SONiC containers (open-source network OS).

üìå Use Case:
	‚Ä¢	You will launch and destroy network topologies from this VM.
	‚Ä¢	All container-based routers and switches (e.g., SONiC, XRd) run here.
	‚Ä¢	You may also use this VM for container debugging, packet capture, or log collection.

üß∞ Key Tools:
	‚Ä¢	containerlab
	‚Ä¢	Docker
	‚Ä¢	Edgeshark
	‚Ä¢	Topology definition files (*.clab.yaml)



## ubuntu-jalapeno ‚Äî The SDN Controller Plane

IP Address: 198.18.128.101

This VM runs Project Jalapeno, an SDN automation framework focused on building control planes for tunnel-based networking, such as:
	‚Ä¢	Data center overlays (VXLAN, EVPN)
	‚Ä¢	Traffic Engineering controllers
	‚Ä¢	SD-WAN logic

Jalapeno introduces a modular and graph-based data modeling platform that can:
	‚Ä¢	Ingest data from the lab topology (via streaming telemetry or config APIs)
	‚Ä¢	Build a topology model in a graph database
	‚Ä¢	Support path computation or automation apps

üìå Use Case:
	‚Ä¢	This VM collects state and topology data from your lab network
	‚Ä¢	It builds a real-time graph model of your infrastructure
	‚Ä¢	It can drive path computations, config pushes, or analytics workflows

üß∞ Key Tools & Components (installed via shell scripts):
	‚Ä¢	ONOS (for control logic)
	‚Ä¢	Graph databases (like JanusGraph)
	‚Ä¢	REST/gRPC APIs



## Windows-management ‚Äî The Student Interface

IP Address: 198.18.128.102

This is a Windows-based management VM used by each student to interact with the lab environment.

üìå Use Case:
	‚Ä¢	Students RDP into this VM as their main entry point.
	‚Ä¢	They use tools like:
	‚Ä¢	PuTTY / SSH / VS Code to access devices
	‚Ä¢	Wireshark GUI for packet captures


üß∞ Key Tools Available to Students:
	‚Ä¢	RDP access
	‚Ä¢	Wireshark GUI
	‚Ä¢	Web browser (Chrome or Firefox)
	‚Ä¢	SSH client
	‚Ä¢	Visual Studio Code (optional: Remote SSH plugin)
