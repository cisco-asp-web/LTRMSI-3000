# Welcome to LTMSI-3000: Modern AI networks: IOS-XR, SRv6, Cilium, and SONiC

## Lab Credentials:

Before starting the lab, please connect to the lab using these [credentials.](https://github.com/cisco-asp-web/LTRMSI-3000/blob/main/LTRMSI-3000-credentials.csv)

## Introduction: 

In this immersive hands-on lab we will explore how to build SRv6 WAN networks utilizing L3VPNs, next-generation AI fabric load balancing using SRv6, and Kubernetes-native SRv6 with Cilium. This lab session walks participants through a series of progressive tutorials and labs covering:

 - SRv6 fundamentals and foundational building blocks for SRv6 L3VPN and Traffic Engineering 

 - Kubernetes integration using Cilium and SRv6 for modern service-aware routing 
  
 - SONiC-based data center fabric bring-up and host-based SRv6 
  
 - Programmatic traffic control using custom SRv6 mappings and intelligent automation 
  
Participants will gain practical skills in deploying flexible, scalable, and programmable infrastructure purpose-built for AI, HPC, or cloud-native workloads.

## Github Repository Overview
Each of the labs is designed to be completed in the order presented. Lab 1 will launch our XRd topology with baseline configurations. In each subsequent lab (2-3) we'll add SRv6 configurations on network and host devices. In lab 4-5 we switch to SONIC to discover new AI use cases for backend networks utilizing SRv6.

# dCloud Instances 

Each lab instance is running on Cisco dCloud and is reachable via AnyConnect VPN. In the Webex Teams room for the lab we've provided a spreadsheet with a list of dCloud instances and the AnyConnect credentials necessary to access each instance. To find your dCloud instance please reference your student number provided on the handout in class.


# dCloud lab Topology

The following diagram shows the dCloud VM topology that will be used for this lab:

## Navigate through the labs.

1. Connect to your dCloud instance VPN

![VPN](./topo_drawings/anyconnect.png)

Once you've connected to VPN all nodes in the lab can be accessed using a Remote Desktop connection to the windows management hosts at 198.18.128.102 (admin / C1sco12345)

![windows-rdpy](./topo_drawings/windows-rdp.png)

On the Windows virtual machine, please launch firefox you shoud arrive on the github page automatically. Please proceed to [LAB 1](https://github.com/cisco-asp-web/LTRMSI-3000/blob/main/lab_1/lab_1-guide.md)
