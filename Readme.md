# Welcome to LTMSI-3000: Modern AI networks: IOS-XR, SRv6, Cilium, and SONiC

## Introduction: 

In this immersive hands-on lab, explore how to build SRv6 WAN networks utilizing L3VPNs, next-generation AI networking fabrics using SRv6, Kubernetes-native SRv6 with Cilium, and open-source data center technologies. You‚Äôll explore a new way to architect, program, and optimize traffic in high-performance compute environments using Cisco IOS-XR and SONiC. This lab session walks participants through a series of progressive tutorials and labs covering:

 - SRv6 fundamentals and foundational building blocks for SRv6 L3VPN and Traffic Engineering 

 - Kubernetes integration using Cilium and SRv6 for modern service-aware routing 
  
 - SONiC-based data center fabric bring-up and host-based SRv6 
  
 - Programmatic traffic control using custom SRv6 mappings and intelligent automation 
  
Participants will gain practical skills in deploying flexible, scalable, and programmable infrastructure purpose-built for AI, HPC, or cloud-native workloads. Whether you‚Äôre a network engineer, cloud architect, or AI infrastructure specialist, this session bridges the gap between architecture and hands-on implementation.

## Github Repository Overview
Each of the labs is designed to be completed in the order presented. Lab 1 will launch our XRd topology with baseline configurations. In each subsequent lab (2-3) we'll add SRv6 configurations on network and host devices. In lab 4-5 we switch to SONIC to discover new AI use cases for backend networks utilizing SRv6.

# dCloud Instances 

Each lab instance is running on Cisco dCloud and is reachable via AnyConnect VPN. In the Webex Teams room for the lab we've provided a spreadsheet with a list of dCloud instances and the AnyConnect credentials necessary to access each instance. To find your dCloud instance please reference your student number provided on the handout in class.


# dCloud lab Topology

The following diagram shows the dCloud VM topology that will be used for this lab:

This lab environment provides a hands-on experience with modern, programmable network infrastructures using modular technologies: SONiC, XRd, Containerlab, Edgeshark, and Jalapeno.

To support this, we are using four virtual machines, each with a specific role. Here‚Äôs what each VM is responsible for:
